<!--chapter:end:index.Rmd-->

# January 12, Learning R

```{r knitr learningR, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

```{r load packages, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(socviz)
library(gapminder) # data on life expectancy, GDP per capita, pop 
library(here)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

### What R looks like

Code you can type and run

```{r}
# Inside code chunks, lines beginning with a # character are comments
# Coments are ignored by R

my_numbers <- c(1, 1, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 5)
```

By convention, code output in documents is prefixed by \#\#

```{r code, echo = FALSE}
my_numbers
```

### Everything in R has a name

```{r names}
my_numbers
letters
pi
```

**Forbidden** names

```{r forbbidden names, eval = FALSE}
TRUE
FALSE
Inf
NaN
NA

for
while
if
```

The `c()` function *combines* or *concatenates* things

```{r c function}
object <- c("b", "e", "n")
object
```

Use alt and - on Windows to use the assignment operator `<-` inside an code chunk. On the other hand, `=` has a different meaning when used in functions. You can use it for the `<-` assignment though. Just be consistent.

```{r object}
object = c("b", "e", "n")
object
```

### Do things to objects with a function

Functions take *inputs* to *arguments*. They perform *actions*. They produce, or return, *outputs*

```{r function}
mean(x = my_numbers)
```

In this case, the input is `my_numbers`, the argument is the vector `x`. The action is calculating the mean (e.g. the sum of the vector over its length). Finally, the function returns a vector of 1 length as an output, in other words, the mean of 2.25.

When you do not know what a function does, use `?` or `??` in the console followed by the function's name to read its documentation.

Functions can return things besides vectors.

```{r function outputs}
summary_numbers <- summary(my_numbers)
summary_numbers
class(summary_numbers)
```

The `rm` command can get rid of objects in the environment.

```{r rm}
rm(summary_numbers)
```

Functions can also be nested.

```{r nested functions}
c(1:20)

mean(c(1:20))

summary(mean(c(1:20)))

names(summary(mean(c(1:20))))

length(names(summary(c(1:20))))
```

Instead of nesting functions in parentheses, we can use the pipe operator `%>%`. This places the previous output into the first argument of the next. We can typically read the pipe as "and then."

```{r pipe}
c(1:20) %>% 
  mean() %>% 
  summary() %>%
  names() %>% 
  length()
```

The shortcut for the pipe operator is control + shift + m.

### Types and classes

The object inspector in RStudio is your friend.

You can ask an object what it is.

```{r}
class(letters)

typeof(letters)
```

It is important to know what class or type an object because functions may only work with certain types.

```{r}
sum(my_numbers)

# sum(letters) would not work
```

### First plots

```{r first plot}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = log(gdpPercap),
                          y = lifeExp))
p + geom_point()

# the same plot could be created using geom smooth

p + geom_smooth()
```

# January 19, Ways of Seeing

### Berger and Renaissance Art

> The process of seeing paintings, or seeing anything else, is less spontaneous than we are led to believe.
>
> \- John Berger

-   There is a history of visual graphics that we need to contextualize in our own work.

-   The reproduction of images especially changes the way that we look at art or other graphics.

-   You have to 'read' paintings and look for its language.

"Works of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction" --Walter Benjamin

-   Argues that reproduction 'devalues' the aura of art (e.g. Mona Lisa).

-   Its value is really contingent on the context in which its produced and exists today.

    -   Ex: nakedness, male gaze, etc.

When we create data visualizations, we should consider the audience that will read it. Are we trying to explain something to them or persuade them, etc.?

### Visual Literacy of Quantitative Data

Anscombe's Quartet: Four scatterplots that produce the same summary statistics and line of best fit. We should look at data more closely to see what's going on.

Voter turnout vs. Inequality: South Africa as an outlier in the 1970's.

-   Included models with South Africa and not.

Collected calls from Milwaukee to see how many to 911, after police brutality predicted that they would decrease trust and therefore 911 calls. Plot showed estimated calls and counterfactual.

-   No data points, you should include them rather than just a line.

-   Found seasonality, warmer months had more phone calls.

It's not enough to just draw a line, we must also think about how non-linear processes generate data.

-   We should consider audience and conventions of interpretation.

    -   Pew Research: sugar consumption and decayed teeth. 62% interpreted correctly.

> Is it possible to rework interpretations rather than simply reproducing them?

Choropleth maps: may emphasize geographic structures that are not relevant to the research question. Conventional interpretations emphasize larger areas rather than the smaller ones, for instance.

Data visualizations must juggle clarity, honesty, and truth.

-   What does it mean to be clear? It depends on context.

-   What does it mean to be honest? It depends on audience and conventions of interpretation.

-   What does it mean to be truthful? It depends on the meaning of the data.

What does the quantity of data today do to the way we think about individual experiences?

-   **500,000 dots, does it minimize individual experiences? Or does it better focus our attention to what we can measure, what we can and can't see.**

100 cities January-May 2020, data is both rich and limited.

# Making Graphs

```{r knitr graphs, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
```

```{r load packages graphs, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(socviz)
library(gapminder) # data on life expectancy, GDP per capita, pop 
library(here)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

> The peer review process... and the entire scientific enterprise is not designed to detect fraud.

It is hard to design proceedings to ensure that people are honest with their publications. We often find problems after the fact.

-   Ex: Honor Code

We write out instructions or recipes, rather than doing a series of point-and-click steps.

```{r create plot}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder, 
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                          y = lifeExp)) # links variables to graphical elements on the plot.
p + geom_point()

```

In R, we create **objects** by assigning something to a name. The **assignment operator** (\<-) attaches the output of the function `ggplot` to a the name `p`.

Other aesthetic mappings can include, e.g., `color`, `shape`, and `size`.

-   Mappings do not directly specify the particular, e.g., colors, shapes, and sizes that will appear on the plot. Instead they establish which variables will be represented by which visible elements.

### What exactly is a graph anyway?

We encode the data to create a "faithful representation" of the processes we see at play.

The way people interpret plots depends on how well the data visualization can track back to the data.

```{r second graph}
final_plot_EDIT1 <- p + geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm') + # The geoms are drawn in the order that you provide them
  scale_x_log10(label = scales::dollar_format()) + # Transforms x scale to a log scale. Does not change the data.
  labs(x = 'GDP Per Capita',
       y = 'Life Expectancy in Years',
       title = 'Economic Growth and Life Expectancy',
       subtitle = 'Data points are country-years',
       caption = 'Data source: Gapminder')

final_plot_EDIT1
```

The process of data visualization is additive. We supply functions to change the graph.

-   `scales` package provides graphical scales to map data to aesthetics. Automatically determine breaks and labels.

### How ggplot works: The flow of action

1.  Tidy data

2.  Mapping

3.  Geom

4.  Coordinates, scales

    1.  usual `coord_cartesian()` but sometime another (e.g. polar coordinates in W.E.B. Du Bois plots from World Exposition)

5.  Labels and guides

    1.  `labs()` and `guides()`

6.  Themes

    1.  `theme_minimal()`

There are two kinds of elements:

1.  Visual elements that logically represent the plot (e.g. x and y axis representing quantities)
2.  Others that are not connected to the data set and strictly thematic. These are controlled by a separate set of functions.

## January 26, Making Graphs (Continuation)

### Mapping vs. setting aesthetics

-   Mapping allows the data to be represented. Setting provides a certain visual property that is not dependent on data.

-   Mapping occurs in `aes()` function. Setting occurs in geom functions.

```{r mapping vs setting}
# color is mapped incorrectly. The property of color is mapped to the character string 'purple,' not the color of purple.
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                          y = lifeExp,
                          color = 'purple')) 

# color is set correctly.
p + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess') +
  scale_x_log10()

p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                          y = lifeExp))

p + geom_point(color = 'purple') +
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess') +
  scale_x_log10()
```

In data visualization, some elements will be mapped to **variables**, while others will be set to **values**.

The mapping is passed onto the succeeding geoms.

```{r mapping}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                          y = lifeExp,
                          color = continent,
                          fill = continent))

# Very "busy" graph.
p + geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess') +
  scale_x_log10()

```

Pay close attention to which scales and guides are drawn, and which aren't.

-   The guide shows the color of the point, line, and fill.

-   But we can change by moving the mapping to geom functions rather than `ggplot()`.

```{r altering mapping}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                          y = lifeExp))

# the geom_smooth function does not alter based on continent
p + geom_point(mapping = aes(color = continent)) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'loess') +
  scale_x_log10()
```

Every mapped variable has a scale. Scales are represented by guides by default, unless explicitly removed.

### Palmer Penguins and Simpson's Paradox

-   Changing the mapping of certain aesthetics among geoms can change the interpretation of the graph.

```{r simpsons paradox}
p <- ggplot(data = penguins,
            mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                          y = bill_depth_mm))

p + geom_point(mapping = aes(color = species)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(color = species, fill = species), method = 'lm', se = FALSE) +
  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Bill length (mm)",
       y = "Bill depth (mm)",
       title = "Simpson's Paradox among Penguin Dimensions",
       subtitle = "After Separating by Species",
       caption = "Source: Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research") 
  theme_bw()
```

> Like other rules of syntax, the grammar limits what you can validly say, but it doesn't make what you say intelligible or meaningful.

### Grouped data and group aesthetic

```{r grouped data}
p <- ggplot(data = gapminder,
            mapping = aes(x = year,
                          y = gdpPercap))

# the graph looks bad because the data has more structure than the graph knows. The unit is country-year, not year.
p + geom_line()

# now adding a grouped aesthetic for country.
p <- p + geom_line(mapping = aes(group = country))

# facet wrapping is not a geom. It is a way of arranging geoms.
p + facet_wrap(~ continent)

p + geom_line(color = "gray70",
              mapping = aes(group = country)) +
  geom_smooth(size = 1.1,
              method = 'loess',
              se = FALSE) +
  scale_y_log10(labels = scales::dollar) +
  facet_wrap(~ continent, ncol = 5) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "GDP per Capita",
       title = "GDP per capita on Five Continents")

```

<!--chapter:end:03-graphs.Rmd-->

# Vision Data and Design

## Smoothers

Default `method = 'loess'` is a non-parametric estimation and does not make assumptions about data. We can think of it as a "moving average"

Span width determines the smoothness of the LOESS fit which can have a value between 0 and 1. A higher span gives more weight to a wider set of predictors. So a lower span runs the risk of overfitting the data while a higher span may miss important non-linear areas of the data (`method = 'lm'`).

## Bad taste, bad data, and bad perception

There are different ways that data visualizations can go wrong.
- bad aesthetics
- the underpinning problems of data
- how humans misunderstand visual representations of data.

### Bad taste

"Chart junk" in Tufte's opinion, is bad taste. Visualizations should maximize the number of ideas with the smallest amount of ink.

There is a limit. Going to far in minimizing visual elements can hurt human perceptions of data (box plot example).

### Bad data

Well-designed charts can be misleading if they have junk data.

- Ex: Graph shows that younger people are less likely to think its "'essential' to live in a democracy." 95% CIs are included. Countries are ordered based on mean percentage in favor of democracy. Problems: x-axis includes times but is not a longitudinal study, line implies that there is data between decades. The question is not yes/no to democracy but "on a scale of 1-10 how important is it that you live in a democracy?" 9-10 was coded as yes, 8 and below as no.

### Bad perception

#### Edges and contrasts

"Grid effect" is when we see images that aren't real in negative space when they intersect with edges.

They are not illusions in the same way that a magic trick is an illusion. You can't "see through the trick" once you learn what is going on. 

Contrasts seem larger when they the colors are touching each other. The background also makes a difference because it sets up a contrast. In other words, we perceive color relatively rather than absolutely.

Gray-scale contrasts are much more easily perceived than color ones (evolutionarily, this stems from the fact that humans got color vision later than grayscale).

- However, certain palettes are better than others in representing contrasts.

#### Color

Color is complicated. It is both objective (wavelengths) and subjective (what you see). 

How do the colors we choose to represent quantities with map the underlying numbers that we think they represent?

- A rainbow scheme often does not do that.

- Color scales that are luminance balanced should be chosen.

#### Pre-attentive processing

We can use color to emphasize one point, regardless of volume.
- Does not work as easily for shapes and it gets harder when we increase volume.

- A plot should not be overwhelmed with mappings.

## Gestalt inferences

The habit or tendency to want to group things together.
- By position, by color, by shape, or by connections (lines, shaded areas)

# Textual Analysis

## Gutenberg data

```{r knitr textual analysis, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
```

```{r libraries textual analysis, include = FALSE}
library(gutenbergr)
library(tidytext)
library(socviz)
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
```

Gutenberg package helps us download plain text files of literature included in the repository.

```{r}
# Finding author
gutenberg_works() %>%
  filter(gutenberg_author_id == 1039)

# Downloading Ulysses
raw_text <- gutenberg_download(gutenberg_id = 4300)

# Tidying data, tokenization process removes possessives, punctuation.
full_text <- raw_text %>% 
  mutate(line = row_number()) %>% 
  unnest_tokens(output = word, input = text, token = 'words')
```

```{r}
full_text %>% 
  count(word, sort = TRUE)

head(stop_words)
```

Stop words include the, and, of, and other nuts and bolts of grammar.

We will anti-join by taking out any words in `full_text` that are included in `stop_words`.

```{r}
full_text %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  filter(! str_detect(word, "'")) %>%
  filter(! str_detect(word, "’")) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(20) %>%
  mutate(word=reorder(word, n))
```

What sort of questions can we ask about this data? One option is sentiment analysis, a means of determining whether the text is more positive or negative.

```{r}
full_text %>% 
  inner_join(get_sentiments('bing')) %>% 
  count(sentiment, word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  group_by(sentiment) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  slice(1:20) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = n, y = word, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col() +
  facet_wrap(~ sentiment, scales = "free") +
  guides(fill = 'none')
```


```{r}
full_text %>% 
  inner_join(get_sentiments('nrc')) %>% 
  count(sentiment, word, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  group_by(sentiment) %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = n,
                       y = word,
                       fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col() +
  guides(fill = 'none') +
  facet_wrap(~ sentiment,
             scales = 'free',
             ncol = 3)
```

Now with Bigrams

```{r}
tidy_ngram <- raw_text %>% 
  unnest_tokens(output = bigram, input = text, token = 'ngrams', n = 2) %>% 
  separate(bigram, c('word1', 'word2'), sep = ' ') %>% 
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word, !word2 %in% stop_words$word) %>% 
  count(word1, word2)
```

```{r}
he_she <- raw_text %>% 
  unnest_tokens(bigram, text, token = 'ngrams', n = 2) %>% 
  separate(bigram, c('word1', 'word2'), sep = ' ') %>% 
  filter(word1 %in% c('he', 'she', 'they')) %>% 
  filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word, !str_detect('word2', "'")) %>% 
  count(word1, word2)

he_she %>% 
  group_by(word1) %>% 
  slice(1:20) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = n, y = word2, fill = word1)) +
  geom_col() +
  guides(fill = 'none') +
  facet_wrap(~ word1, scales = 'free')
```


## Tidydata

Underpinning any textual analysis is *tidy* data (tibble).

- Every variable gets its own column
- Every row is an observation
- Every cell is a value.

`ggplot` accepts tidy data. Some data frames are not tidy.

- Example: Census data can organize education by several variables, such as elementary education being split into 0-4 years and 5-8 years. Spreading a variable across several columns means that it isn't tidy.

- Excel sheets with a title row going across the data. Bolded or shaded information in a column that denotes a certain variable.

Pivot commands can transform the shape of the data. Usually we need to move to longer format.

```{r}
head(edu, 5) # Needs to be transformed into long-form

# Pick the columns that need to be put into a single column in cols argument. Then name the column. Finally, assign the values for the four colums to value_to argument.

edu %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = elem4:coll4, names_to = "educ", values_to = "n") %>% 
  head(5)
```

Pivoting wider

```{r}
# Take every value from year into its own column

gapminder %>%  
  pivot_wider(names_from = year, values_from = lifeExp:gdpPercap) %>% 
  head(5)
```

## Saving your Work

`ggsave` helps save individual plots. By default, it saves the most recent plot that was made. More easily, `ggsave` can save objects in the environment.


<!--chapter:end:05-textualanalysis.Rmd-->

# Tidy Data

```{r knitr tidy, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message = FALSE)
```

```{r setup tidy, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(socviz)

theme_set(theme_minimal())
```

> Problem set 2 will substitute the midterm project.

We want to transform and summarize first before sending clean tables to `ggplot()`.

## Counts are easy

Use `geom_bar` to summarize counts. Stacked bar charts are not easy to interpret, so we can change `position = 'dodge'`, we can see the proportions of counts using the `mapping = fill`.

## Transform data first if dealing with proportions or other summary statistics

Row percents/row marginals and column percents/columns marginals (do rows sum to 100% or do columns?). We can also calculate total percents.

`dplyr` lets you manipulate tables in a series of steps or a **pipeline**.

### `group_by()`

Groups the data at a lavel we want, such as "religion by Region" or "Authors by Publications by Year".

### `filter()` and `select()`

Subsets table based on rows and columns, respectively

### `Mutate()`

changes the data by creating new cvariables at the current level of grouping.

### `Summarize()`

Creates summary statistics for grouped data.

## GSS Data example

```{r gss longhand}
rel_by_region <- gss_sm %>% 
  group_by(bigregion, religion) %>% # group by bigregion and religion. Read right to left using 'within' or left to right using 'by'
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(freq = n / sum(n),
         pct = round((freq * 100), 1))
```

### Objects in pipeline carry forward assumptions

For example, the `group_by()` groups carries over to the `summarize()` and `mutate()` functions.

The variable `n` created by `summarize()` can be used in the `mutate()` line. We can also use `freq` immediately after creating it.

### Shorthand version

```{r gss shorthand, echo=FALSE}
gss_sm %>% 
  group_by(bigregion, religion) %>% 
  tally() # Produces the same output as summarize without as much code.

gss_sm %>% 
  count(bigregion, religion) # No group_by necessary, but this means no groups are created.
```

### Pipeline tables are easier to check for errors

```{r pipeline easy, echo=FALSE}
rel_by_region %>% 
  group_by(bigregion) %>% 
  summarize(total = sum(pct))
```

### GSS Graph

```{r gss plot}
p <- ggplot(data = rel_by_region,
            mapping = aes(x = bigregion,
                          y = pct,
                          fill = religion))

p + geom_col(position = 'dodge')
```

But this is not an effective graph!

```{r}
p <- ggplot(data = rel_by_region,
            mapping = aes(x = pct,
                          y = religion,
                          fill = religion))

p + geom_col(position = 'dodge') +
  labs(x = 'Percent', y = NULL) +
  guides(fill = 'none') +
  facet_wrap(~ bigregion, nrow = 1)
```

- Try putting categories on the y-axis. 

- Try faceting variables instead of mapping them.

- Try to minimize the need for guides and legends.

> Note that these rules are not absolute.

## Other forms of facetting

### Facetting multiple variables

```{r facet wrap multiple}
p <- ggplot(data = gss_sm, mapping = aes(x = age, y = childs))

p + geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth() + facet_wrap(~ sex + race, nrow = 1) + # The formula syntax isn't limited to one variable
  theme_minimal()
```

### Facet grid

```{r facet grid}
p + geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth() + facet_grid(race ~ sex) # The dimensions of the table are defined. Race by sex.
```

Be careful of breaking the data into too many categories; data may not have enough observations of each category.

## The Process

- Full data and then

- Subset data and then

- Grouped calculation and then

- New columns or further summary and then

- Plot and polish.

## Organ Data

```{r organ plot 1}
organdata %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year, y = donors, group = country)) +
  geom_line() + facet_wrap(~ reorder(country, -donors, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

```{r organ plot 2}
organdata %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = donors, y = reorder(country, donors, fill = world, na.rm = TRUE))) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(x = "Donors", y = NULL, fill = "Welfare State")
```


<!--chapter:end:06-tidy.Rmd-->

# What is Data

Sports are a "model organism" of social science. The rules provide a rigid and episodic but still socially real model of human behavior.

Random: Use `glue` package to add color to the titles and other labels.

## History of Data

There is a relationship between the history of data and the development of *markets* and the *state*.

Categories used in data both reflect and express historically-contingent social formations.

- Categories from North Carolina's 1790 census sets up the hierarchy from free white males to slaves.

  - Later focus on how to categorize people who interracial through langauge of "Mulatto, Quadroom, Octoroon..." during Jim Crow.

There are three broad ideas about the relationships between categories and the what we think of as the world or reality.

- "Carving nature at the joints," trying to see what the world *objectively* looks like.

- Process of data collection is subjective (e.g. American vs. French beef cuts).

- Realists argue that there is an objective and subjective experience; purpose of science to approximate objectivity.

Categories should be exclusive and exhaustive (i.e. observations cannot belong to more than one category and every observation should fit a category).

# Pandemic Data

```{r setup pandemic, include = FALSE, messag=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(socviz)
library(here)
library(covdata)
library(slider)
library(patchwork)
```

```{r knitr pandemic, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, collapse=TRUE)
```

### Vegetable Fat and Animal Fat Plot

The amount of vegetable fat is increasing but animal fat mostly steady. The conclusion is that "added fats and oils... increased by almost 30 pounds between 1970 and 2010." 

- The number of firms reporting vegetable oil production increased.

- **After a sudden change in a variable over time, the question should be "how has the collection of this data changed?"**

### COVID-19

Similarly, data collection about COVID-19 has changed over time, distorting the statistics that we might use.

Reporting delays alter interpretations. 

- So date of report vs. date of specimen collection are altered by weekly trends (more tests on Monday). Inferences can lead analysts to conclude the cases/tests are falling when they aren't.

```{r pandemic data}
country_rank <- stmf %>% 
  filter(sex == 'b', year > 2014 & year < 2020) %>% 
  select(country_code, cname, iso3, year:sex, age_group, death_rate, rate_total) %>% 
  group_by(country_code) %>% 
  summarize(mean_rate = mean(rate_total, na.rm = TRUE)) 
```

#### `dplyr`'s window functions

```{r cumsum}
covnat_weekly %>% 
  filter(iso3 == 'USA') %>% 
  select(date, cname, iso3, cases) %>% 
  mutate(cumulative = cumsum(cases))
```

`cume_dist()` gives the proportion of values less than or equal to the current

```{r cume_dist}
covnat_weekly %>% 
  select(date, cname, iso3, deaths) %>% 
  filter(iso3 == 'USA') %>% 
  mutate(cume_dist(desc(deaths) < 0.1)) # i.e. top ten percent
```

`lead()` and `lag()` functions allow you to access the previous and next values in a vector

```{r lag}
my_vec <- c(1:20) 
my_vec

lag(my_vec)

my_vec - lag(my_vec)
```

So this allows us to calculate off-sets.

```{r covus}
# covus %>% 
#   select(-date_quality_grade) %>% 
#   filter(measure == 'death') %>% 
#   group_by(state) %>% 
#   arrange(date) %>% 
#   mutate(deaths_daily = count - lag(count, order_by = date))
```

We can always write functions using `function()`.

```{r get_daily_count}
get_daily_count <- function(count, date) {
  count = lag(count, order_by = date)
}
```

It is more useful to use functions when we want to perform several steps on the data.

`dplyr`'s window functions don't include moving averages, so we can use the `slider` package.

```{r slider}
covus %>%
  select(-data_quality_grade) %>%
  filter(measure == 'death') %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  arrange(date) %>%
  mutate(deaths_daily = get_daily_count(count, date),
         deaths7 = slide_mean(deaths_daily, before = 7, na_rm = TRUE)) %>%
  arrange(state, desc(date)) %>%
  filter(state %in% 'NY')
```
There are other `slider` functions like `slide_max()` and `slide_min()`.

#### Patchwork

`patchwork` allows us to arrange several plots together.

```{r pathwork}
# p1 + p2 + p3 + guide_area() +
# plot_layout(ncol = 2, guides = 'collect')
```

`guides = 'collect'` combines legends together so that it doesn't appear multiple times.
